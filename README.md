<p>This project is an inventory tracking application. It preforms 3 major tasks</p>
<ol>
  <li>Allows the user to manage and update an inventory of all the components that go in the GX-5 and GX-35 system</li>
  <li>Allows the user to organize the components into individual kits for a system.</li>
  <li> Once a kit is manufactured into a system, the user can keep track of the status and possibly the QC data for that system</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Next sprint: </strong>March </p>
